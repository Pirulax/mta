# mta

The [proposals](/proposals) directory contains ideas in the form of **proposals** for MTA. These are all **drafts**.

Feel free to send pull requests if you'd like to expand on my drafts. I'll let you know what I think about your suggestions and I am open to merging them to this repository.

Please first discuss with me if:

1. You'd like to submit any of these as actual proposals (modified or otherwise) to the mtasa-blue repo. I may have other things in mind that I have not written down.
2. You like the idea, and want me to complete and submit the proposal.
